Rx wrapped GeoFence library, built on top of `GeoFire` well, maybe in the future we can choose the engine ( such as Awarness API) or maybe or own implementation :punch:

##Download
```groovy
allprojects {
		repositories {
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
```	
```
dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.esafirm:android-rxgeofence:latest-version'
	}
```
	
##Setup

```java
 RxGeoFence.with(this) //context
        .dbUrl(GEO_FIRE_DB) //String
        .geoFenceSource(...) // rx.Observable<List<Place>>
        .locationSource(...) // rx.Observable<LatLng>
        .build()
        .subscribe(geoFenceEvent -> {
         // do what you wanna do with the event
     });
```

You can see the implementation on the example. 

##Running Sample

 1. Create `gradle.properties` in the root of the project
 2. Add `Firebase` database URL and `GoogleMap` API key to your `gradle.properties`

```
#gradle.properties

GEO_FIRE_DB="ENTER_YOUR_FIREBASE_DB_URL_HERE"
MAP_KEY=ENTER_YOUT_MAP_API_KEY_HERE
```

~ *You're good to go*
